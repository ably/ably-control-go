# Contributing to ably-control-go

1. Fork `github.com/ably/ably-control-go`
2. create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. ensure your code is formatted with `go fmt`
5. ensure you have added suitable tests and the test suite is passing.
6. push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
7. create a new Pull Request.

## Running Tests

The tests are ran against a real Ably account. For this to work `ABLY_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`
must be set with a valid [access token](https://ably.com/docs/control-api#creating-access-token).

Additionally, `ABLY_CONTROL_URL` can be set to an alternative control API endpoint.

The tests can then be ran with:

```
go test -v
``` 

## Release process

This library uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). For each release, the following needs to be done:

1. Make sure the tests are passing in CI for the branch you're building
2. Create a new branch for the release, for example `release/1.2.3`
3. Update the CHANGELOG.md with any customer-affecting changes since the last release and add this to the git index
4. Set the `VERSION` constant in `version.go` to the new version number and add this to the git index
5. Create a PR for the release branch
6. Once the PR is approved, merge it into `main`
7. Run `git tag <VERSION_NUMBER>` with the new version and push the tag to git
8. Create the release on Github, from the new tag, including populating the release notes
9. Update the [Ably Changelog](https://changelog.ably.com/) (via [headwayapp](https://headwayapp.co/)) with these changes (again, you can just copy the notes you added to the CHANGELOG)
